#PseudoCode

-- Sort movements from lesser to greater

Done

-- Make a graph with all the possible movements, from closest to furthest

1. starting position must be root. 
2. add each movement to the tree

-- make a movement class

1. it must contain x, y, distance (steps)

-- adjacency lists

for each 'space' in the board
an object would store it better
key counter, which would be board size (8 * 8 default)

need to change the functions that explore X and Y movements and have only this.x/y as reference
