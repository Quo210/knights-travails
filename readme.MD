Found some progress with the overall exercise by doing the original Knight's Tour. It doesn't work to find a solution to my particular problem, but I am pushing towards it.

Next step:

Refine the function to be just a Knight's Tour. Then Think on how to apply the new learned concepts into my own problem.
