Found some progress with the overall exercise by doing the original Knight's Tour. It doesn't work to find a solution to my particular problem, but I am pushing towards it.

Next step:

Refine the function to be just a Knight's Tour. Then Think on how to apply the new learned concepts into my own problem.

1. Rework exploreX/Y to release it from Knight's properties [X]
2. Refine exploreAxis to release it from Knight properties  [X]
3. Rework pathfinder function because current one is a mess [x]
3.1 Use proper naming when naming things. [x]
4. Correct the infite loop error on the while check right before recursion happens in findRoute [x]



Next:

1. Correct array identification problem (being confused with objects??) in new function
